# üöÄ LangGraph Exercises

A collection of exercises and implementations from the [FreeCodeCamp LangGraph course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGg_1h0qzaM) taught by Vaibhav Mehra.


## üìö About the Course

This repository contains exercises and solutions from the FreeCodeCamp course on LangGraph. LangGraph is a library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs using graphs. It extends the LangChain framework to allow for more complex agent workflows and conversations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Usage

1. **Clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Langraph-excercises.git
   cd Langraph-excercises
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   # or
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Setup your API keys**
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory
   - Add your API keys (Groq API key for LLM access)
   ```
   GROQ_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   ```

4. **Run the examples**
   ```bash
   python Lessons/lesson.py
   python excercises/excercise1.py
   python Agents/Agent1.py
   ```
